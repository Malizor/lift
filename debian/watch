# GitHub has recently (9/22) changed the behavior of the releases page in a way
# that breaks watch files [1]. This file works around that by looking for files on
# the 'tags' page, then rewriting them to reference the expected file on the
# 'releases' page, and then verifies using the corresponding signature file.
